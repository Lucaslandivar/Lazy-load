<p>My goal with this project was to be able to generate images in any type to internet connection, the function was very simple and the project is very simple itself, i only did it to learn this function.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>This project will only load the images that the user is seeing, if the user is in the top the images in the bottom will not load, they will load once the user go down. To see it by yourself go to the network option in the browser and enable the "3g slow" option.</p>
